# ChordFlow

**Build workflows that work everywhere your AI does**

ChordFlow is a universal workflow platform that connects any tool to any AI assistant. Create workflows once and run them in Cursor, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, and beyond‚Äîwith human oversight at every step.

## üöÄ What is ChordFlow?

ChordFlow solves the fundamental problem of AI assistant isolation. Instead of rebuilding the same processes in every AI tool, ChordFlow lets you create intelligent workflows that work universally across all your AI assistants while keeping you in control.

### Core Problems We Solve
- **AI Isolation**: Your AI assistants work in silos, losing context between tasks
- **Repetitive Work**: You rebuild the same multi-step processes over and over
- **Tool Fragmentation**: No way to connect your favorite tools across different AI apps
- **Team Inconsistency**: Teams can't share or standardize their AI workflows

## ‚ö° Key Features

### üåê Universal AI Integration
Works with **any AI assistant** that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol):
- Cursor IDE
- Claude Desktop
- ChatGPT
- Windsurf
- And many more

### üîß Connect Any Tool
Integrate with your entire tech stack:
- **Development**: GitHub, GitLab, Vercel, AWS, Docker, npm
- **Productivity**: Slack, Notion, Google Drive, Airtable, Linear, Jira
- **Custom**: Any API, command line tool, or service with an endpoint

### üë§ Human-in-the-Loop Control
- Set approval gates wherever you need them
- Review outputs and make changes before workflows continue
- Maintain oversight while automating routine tasks
- You stay in control of every decision point

### üß† LLMScript Engine
Write workflows that think using our executable AI reasoning language:
- **Human-readable**: Written in natural language that both humans and AI understand
- **Machine-executable**: Converts human reasoning into actionable automation
- **Context-aware**: Access to your documents, team data, and external tools
- **Flexible**: Support for conditions, loops, and complex decision trees

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Setup

1. **Get your API key** from [chordflow.ai](https://chordflow.ai)

2. **Configure your AI assistant**:

   **For Cursor IDE:**

         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
